        "content": "<p>If you're considering hair transplantation, understanding the recovery process is just as important as the procedure itself. In this post, we'll walk you through what happens after hair transplantation and how to care for your new hair to achieve the best results.</p><h2>1. Immediate Care</h2><p>It's normal to experience mild swelling, redness, and scabbing in the treated area after the procedure. Your doctor will provide detailed instructions on how to clean your scalp and when to start washing your hair again. It's recommended not to touch, scratch, or wear headgear on the treated area for the first few days.</p><h2>2. Shedding Phase</h2><p>Don't worry if your newly transplanted hair begins to fall out after 2-3 weeks - this is completely normal. This is called 'shock loss' and is a temporary part of the healing process. New, stronger hair will begin to grow in its place.</p><h2>3. Hair Growth Timeline</h2><p>‚Ä¢ 3-4 months: Fine hairs begin to appear.</p><p>‚Ä¢ 6 months: Noticeable improvement and thickening of strands.</p><p>‚Ä¢ 12 months and beyond: Full results become visible.</p><p>Everyone's hair grows at different rates, but by one year, most patients enjoy a full head of hair with a natural appearance.</p><h2>4. Tips for Fast and Healthy Recovery</h2><p>‚Ä¢ Follow all aftercare instructions from your clinic completely.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Avoid strenuous physical activity for at least one week.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy diet.</p><p>‚Ä¢ Be patient ‚Äî hair growth takes time.</p><h4>Ready to start your hair restoration journey?
